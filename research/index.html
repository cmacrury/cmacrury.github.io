We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by the modern tool of Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution. In NRM and revenue management problems, customer substitution induces a negative correlation between products being demanded, making it difficult to apply the standard definition of OCRS. We start by deriving a more powerful notion of "random-element" OCRS that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature. We show this benchmark is unbeatable for all integers L that are the power of a prime number, using a construction based on finite affine planes. We then show how to beat this benchmark under any of three assumptions: 1) no customer substitution (i.e., in the standard OCRS setting); 2) products comprise one item from each of up to L groups; or 3) customers arrive in a uniformly random (instead of fixed adversarial) order. Finally, we show that under both assumptions 1) and 3), it is possible to do better than offline CRS when L\ge 5. Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to having no substitution. Our result under assumption 2) implies that 1/(1+L) can be beaten for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L partition matroids, a problem of interest. In sum, our paper shows how to apply OCRS to all of these problems and establishes a surprising separation in the achievable guarantees when substitution is involved, under general resource constraints parametrized by L.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> <h1 class="post-title"> <font size="5.5"> Accepted Papers </font> </h1> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="duppala2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Proportionally Fair Matching Algorithms via Randomized Rounding</div> <div class="author"> Sharmila Duppala , Nathaniel Grammel , Juan Luque , <em>Calum MacRury</em>, and Aravind Srinivasan </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) as an oral presentation</em> , 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11238" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/duppala_2025_fairness.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Given an edge-colored graph, the goal of the proportional fair matching problem is to find a maximum weight matching while ensuring proportional representation (with respect to the number of edges) of each color. The colors may correspond to demographic groups or other protected traits where we seek to ensure roughly equal representation from each group. It is known that, assuming ETH, it is impossible to approximate the problem with \ell colors in time subexponential in \ell, even on unweighted path graphs. Further, even determining the existence of a non-empty matching satisfying proportionality is NP-Hard. To overcome this hardness, we relax the stringent proportional fairness constraints to a probabilistic notion. We introduce a definition we call δ-ProbablyAlmostFair, where we ensure proportionality up to a factor of at most (1 + δ) for some small δ&gt;0 with high probability. The violation δcan be brought arbitrarily close to 0 for some good instances with large values of matching size. We propose and analyze simple and fast algorithms for bipartite graphs that achieve constant-factor approximation guarantees, and return a δ-ProbablyAlmostFair matching. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bennett2023de" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Extending Wormald’s Differential Equation Method to One-sided Bounds</div> <div class="author"> Patrick Bennett , and <em>Calum MacRury</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Combinatorics, Probability and Computing</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12358" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963548325000033" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/bennett_2023_de.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this note, we formulate a “one-sided” version of Wormald’s differential equation method.

The regime with vanishing edge probabilities is interesting for several reasons: 1) in applications such as online advertising, an edge represents a customer clicking an ad and the probability of any such event is tiny; 2) in settings where worst-case instances for contention resolution schemes are known, they have vanishing edge probabilities; 3) this is the main regime of interest in the literature on Erdős–Rényi random graphs. When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is 0.382-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption. Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than 0.390-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of 0.428 from the literature. Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy CRS which accepts all active and feasible edges is 1/2-selectable. This result is tight due to a known upper bound. Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order—give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order—results in a strictly better OCRS that is 1-log(2-1/e)≈0.510-selectable. Our positive results also apply to online matching on 1-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from that literature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="macrury2023induction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Random-order Contention Resolution via Continuous Induction: Tightness for Bipartite Matching under Vertex Arrivals</div> <div class="author"> <em>Calum MacRury</em>, and Will Ma </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC)</em> , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10101" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3618260.3649788" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/macrury_2023_induction.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We introduce a new approach for designing Random-order Contention Resolution Schemes (RCRS’s) via exact solution in continuous time. Given a function c(y):[0,1] →[0,1], we show how to select each element which arrives at time y ∈[0,1] with probability \textitexactly c(y). We provide a rigorous algorithmic framework for achieving this, which discretizes the time interval and also needs to sample its past execution to ensure these exact selection probabilities. We showcase our framework in the context of online contention resolution schemes for matching with random-order vertex arrivals. For bipartite graphs with two-sided arrivals, we design a (1+e^-2)/2 ≈0.567-selectable RCRS, which we also show to be tight. Next, we show that the presence of short odd-length cycles is the only barrier to attaining a (tight) (1+e^-2)/2-selectable RCRS on general graphs. By generalizing our bipartite RCRS, we design an RCRS for graphs with odd-length girth g which is (1+e^-2)/2-selectable as g →∞. This convergence happens very rapidly: for triangle-free graphs (i.e., g \ge 5), we attain a 121/240 + 7/16 e^2 ≈0.563-selectable RCRS. Finally, for general graphs we improve on the 8/15 ≈0.533-selectable RCRS of (Fu et al., 2021) and design an RCRS which is at least 0.535-selectable. Due to the reduction of (Ezra et al., 2020), our bounds yield a 0.535-competitive (respectively, (1+e^-2)/2-competitive) algorithm for prophet secretary matching on general (respectively, bipartite) graphs under vertex arrivals.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="macrury2022contention" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On (Random-order) Online Contention Resolution Schemes for the Matching Polytope of (Bipartite) Graphs</div> <div class="author"> <em>Calum MacRury</em>, Will Ma , and Nathaniel Grammel </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Operations Research</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> Conference version appeared <i> in the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2023) </i> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07520" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/opre.2023.0339" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/macrury_2024_contention.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS’s) represent a modern tool for selecting a subset of elements, subject to resource constraints, when the elements are presented to the algorithm sequentially. OCRS’s have led to some of the best-known competitive ratio guarantees for online resource allocation problems, with the added benefit of treating different online decisions – accept/reject, probing, pricing – in a unified manner. This paper analyzes OCRS’s for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline. All in all, our results for OCRS directly improve the best-known competitive ratios for online accept/reject, probing, and pricing problems on graphs in a unified manner.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="frieze2023hamiltonian" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Building Hamiltonian Cycles in the Semi-Random Graph Process in Less Than 2n Rounds</div> <div class="author"> Alan Frieze , Pu Gao , <em>Calum MacRury</em>, Pawel Pralat , and Gregory Sorkin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Accepted to European Journal of Combinatorics</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05533" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/frieze_2023_hamiltonian.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The semi-random graph process is an adaptive random graph process in which an online algorithm is initially presented an empty graph on n vertices.

For a fixed monotone increasing graph property P, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy P in as few steps as possible. Through appropriate choices of D, the D-process generalizes well-studied adaptive random graph processes, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process We prove a sufficient condition for the existence of a sharp threshold for P in the D-process. For the semi-random process, we use this condition to prove the existence of a sharp threshold when P corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to containing a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random graph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when P corresponds to containing a sparse spanning graph. Using a separate analytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form CPn for some fixed constant CP&gt;0. This answers two of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al.

Specifically, we develop a multi-agent simulation framework to model virus spread in complex networks. Our agents periodically commute between home and work via a combination of walking routes and public transit, and make decisions intelligently based upon their location, available routes, and expectations of public transport arrival times. Our infection scheme allows for different contagiousness levels, as a function of the virus’s strain and where the agents interact (i.e., inside or outside). Our results show that the pandemic’s scale is heavily impacted by the network’s structure, and the decision making of the agents. In particular, the progression of the pandemic greatly differs when agents primarily infect each other in a crowded urban transportation system, opposed to while walking. Additionally, the results show that local subgraph characteristics, including topology, structure, and statistics such as its degree distribution and density, affect the viruses’ transmission rates. We also assess the effect of modifying the public transport’s running frequency on the spread of two different virus strains (with different levels of contagiousness). In particular, lowering the running frequency can discourage agents from taking public transportation too often, especially for shorter distances. On the other hand, the low frequency contributes to more crowded streetcars or subway cars if the policy is not designed correctly, which is why such an analysis may prove valuable for finding “sweet spots” that optimize the system. The proposed approach has been validated on real world data, and a model of the transportation network of downtown Toronto. The framework used is flexible and can be easily adjusted to model other urban environments, and additional forms of transportation (such as carpooling, ride-share and more).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="macrury2022phase" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Phase Transition of Discrepancy in Random Hypergraphs</div> <div class="author"> <em>Calum MacRury</em>, Tomáš Masařík , Leilani Pai , and Xavier Pérez-Giménez </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07342" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/21M1451427" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/macrury_2023_discrepancy.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Motivated by the Beck-Fiala conjecture, we study the discrepancy problem in two related models of random hypergraphs on n vertices and m edges. In the first (\em edge-independent) model, a random hypergraph H_1 is constructed by fixing a parameter p and allowing each of the n vertices to join each of the m edges independently with probability p. In the parameter range in which pn →∞and pm →∞, we show that with high probability (\whp) H_1 has discrepancy at least Ω(2^-n/m \sqrtpn) when m = O(n), and at least Ω(\sqrtpn \logγ) when m ≫n, where γ= \min{ m/n, pn}. In the second (\em edge-dependent) model, d is fixed and each vertex of H_2 independently joins exactly d edges uniformly at random. We obtain analogous results for this model by generalizing the techniques used for the edge-independent model with p=d/m. Namely, for d →∞and dn/m →∞, we prove that \whp H_2 has discrepancy at least Ω(2^-n/m \sqrtdn/m) when m = O(n), and at least Ω(\sqrt(dn/m) \logγ) when m ≫n, where γ=\min{m/n, dn/m}. Furthermore, we obtain nearly matching asymptotic upper bounds on the discrepancy in both models (when p=d/m), in the dense regime of m ≫n. Specifically, we apply the partial colouring lemma of Lovett and Meka to show that \whp H_1 and H_2 each have discrepancy O( \sqrtdn/m \log(m/n)), provided d →∞, d n/m →∞and m ≫n. This result is algorithmic, and together with the work of Bansal and Meka characterizes how the discrepancy of each random hypergraph model transitions from Θ(\sqrtd) to o(\sqrtd) as m varies from m=Θ(n) to m ≫n.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="gao2022hamiltonian" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Fully Adaptive Strategy for Hamiltonian Cycles in the Semi-Random Graph Process</div> <div class="author"> Pu Gao , <em>Calum MacRury</em>, and Paweł Prałat </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the International Conference on Randomization and Computation (RANDOM)</em> , 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02350" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/17151/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/gao_2022_hamiltonian.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on n vertices.

(independently distributed) online vertex arrivals. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its weighted edges must be probed (queried) to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. Our algorithms operate in the probe-commit model, in that if a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally, each online node has a downward-closed probing constraint on its adjacent edges which indicates which sequences of edge probes are allowable. Our setting generalizes the commonly studied patience (or timeout) constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an online node’s adjacent edges. Most notably, this includes non-uniform edge probing costs (specified by knapsack/budget constraint). We extend a recently introduced configuration LP to the known i.d. setting, and also provide the first proof that it is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm (the offline adaptive benchmark). Using this LP, we establish new competitive bounds all of which generalize the standard non-stochastic setting when edges do not need to be probed (i.e., exist with certainty). </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="gao2021perfect" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Perfect Matchings in the Semi-random Graph Process</div> <div class="author"> Pu Gao , <em>Calum MacRury</em>, and Paweł Prałat </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13455" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/21M1446939" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/gao_2022_matching.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on n vertices.

The searcher is probabilistically faulty, and detection of the item with each visitation is an independent Bernoulli trial whose probability of success p is known. The objective is to minimize the worst case expected detection time, relative to the distance of the hidden item to the origin. A variation of the same problem was first proposed by Gal in 1980. Then in 2003, Alpern and Gal [The Theory of Search Games and Rendezvous] proposed a so-called monotone solution for searching the line (2-rays); that is, a trajectory in which the newly searched space increases monotonically in each ray and in each iteration. Moreover, they conjectured that an optimal trajectory for the 2-rays problem must be monotone. We disprove this conjecture when the search domain is the half-line (1-ray). We provide a lower bound for all monotone algorithms, which we also match with an upper bound. Our main contribution is the design and analysis of a sequence of refined search strategies, outside the family of monotone algorithms, which we call t-sub-monotone algorithms. Such algorithms induce performance that is strictly decreasing with t, and for all p ∈(0,1). The value of t quantifies, in a certain sense, how much our algorithms deviate from being monotone, demonstrating that monotone algorithms are sub-optimal when searching the half-line.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="dudek_2020_localization" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Localization Game for Random Graphs</div> <div class="author"> Andrzej Dudek , Sean English , Alan Frieze , <em>Calum MacRury</em>, and Paweł Prałat </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Discrete Applied Mathematics</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11225" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166218X21004819" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/posted_papers/dudek_2020_localization.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> We consider the localization game played on graphs in which a cop tries to determine the exact location of an invisible robber by exploiting distance probes.

We consider the competitiveness of online algorithms in both the adversarial order model (AOM) and the random order model (ROM). More specifically, we consider a bipartite stochastic graph G = (U,V,E) where U is the set of offline vertices, V is the set of online vertices and G has edge probabilities (p_e)_e ∈E and edge weights (w_e)_e ∈E. Additionally, G has probing constraints (\scrC_v)_v ∈V, where \scrC_v indicates which sequences of edges adjacent to an online vertex v can be probed. We assume that U is known in advance, and that \scrC_v, together with the edge probabilities and weights adjacent to an online vertex are only revealed when the online vertex arrives.

If a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching (if possible). We study this problem in the generality of a patience (or budget) constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to edges adjacent to an online node. The patience constraint results in modelling and computational efficiency issues that are not encountered in the special cases of unit patience and full (i.e., unlimited) patience. The stochastic matching problem leads to a variety of settings. Our main contribution is to provide a new LP relaxation and a unified approach for establishing new and improved competitive bounds in three different input model settings (namely, adversarial, random order, and known i.i.d.). In all these settings, the algorithm does not have any control on the ordering of the online nodes. We establish competitive bounds in these settings, all of which generalize the standard non-stochastic setting when edges do not need to be probed (i.e., exist with certainty). All of our competitive ratios hold for arbitrary edge probabilities and patience constraints: (1) A 1−1/e ratio when the stochastic graph is known, offline vertices are weighted and online arrivals are adversarial. (2) A 1−1/e ratio when the stochastic graph is known, edges are weighted, and online arrivals are given in random order (i.e., in ROM, the random order model). (3) A 1−1/e ratio when online arrivals are drawn i.i.d. from a known stochastic type graph and edges are weighted.
