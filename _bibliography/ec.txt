abstract = {We study the performance of sequential contention resolution and matching algorithms on random graphs with vanishing edge probabilities. The regime with vanishing edge probabilities is interesting for several reasons: 1) in applications such as online advertising, an edge represents a customer clicking an ad and the probability of any such event is tiny; 2) in settings where worst-case instances for contention resolution schemes are known, they have vanishing edge probabilities; 3) this is the main regime of interest in the literature on Erdős–Rényi random graphs.

When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is $0.382$-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption.
Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than $0.390$-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of $0.428$ from the literature.
Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy CRS which accepts all active and feasible edges is $1/2$-selectable.
This result is tight due to a known upper bound.
Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order---give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order---results in a strictly better OCRS that is $1-log(2-1/e)\approx 0.510$-selectable.
Our positive results also apply to online matching on $1$-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from that literature.},
