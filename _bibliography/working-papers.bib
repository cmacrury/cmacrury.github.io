abstract = {In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to $L$ resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by the modern tool of Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution.

In NRM and revenue management problems, customer substitution induces a negative correlation between products being demanded, making it difficult to apply the standard definition of OCRS. We start by deriving a more powerful notion of "random-element" OCRS that achieves a guarantee of $1/(1+L)$ for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature.
We show this benchmark is unbeatable for all integers $L$ that are the power of a prime number, using a construction based on finite affine planes.
We then show how to beat this benchmark under any of three assumptions: 1) no customer substitution (i.e., in the standard OCRS setting);
2) products comprise one item from each of up to $L$ groups; or
3) customers arrive in a uniformly random (instead of fixed adversarial) order.
Finally, we show that under both assumptions 1) and 3), it is possible to do better than offline CRS when $L\ge 5$.

Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to $L$ items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to having no substitution.
Our result under assumption 2) implies that $1/(1+L)$ can be beaten for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of $L$ partition matroids, a problem of interest.
In sum, our paper shows how to apply OCRS to all of these problems and establishes a surprising separation in the achievable guarantees when substitution is involved,
under general resource constraints parametrized by $L$.},

	abstract = {We use contention resolution schemes (CRS) to derive algorithms for the fair rationing of a single resource when agents have stochastic demands.
We aim to provide ex-ante guarantees on the level of service provided to each agent, who may measure service in different ways (Type-I, II, or III), calling for CRS under different feasibility constraints (rank-1 matroid or knapsack).
We are particularly interested in \textit{two-order} CRS where the agents are equally likely to arrive in a known forward order or its reverse, which is motivated by online rationing at food banks.
Indeed, for a mobile pantry driving along cities to ration food, it is equally efficient to drive that route in reverse on half of the days, and we show that doing so significantly improves the service guarantees that are possible, being more "fair" to the cities at the back of the route.

In particular, we derive a two-order CRS for rank-1 matroids with guarantee $1/(1+e^{-1/2})\approx 0.622$, which we prove is tight.
This improves upon the $1/2$ guarantee that is best-possible under a single order (Alaei, SIAM J. Comput. 2014), while achieving separation with the $1-1/e\approx 0.632$ guarantee that is possible for random-order CRS (Lee and Singla, ESA 2018).
Because CRS guarantees imply prophet inequalities, this also beats the two-order prophet inequality with ratio $(\sqrt{5}-1)/2\approx 0.618$ from (Arsenis, SODA 2021), which was tight for single-threshold policies.
Rank-1 matroids suffice to provide guarantees under Type-II or III service, but Type-I service requires knapsack.
Accordingly, we derive a two-order CRS for knapsack with guarantee $1/3$, improving upon the $1/(3+e^{-2})\approx 0.319$ guarantee that is best-possible under a single order (Jiang et al., SODA 2022).
To our knowledge, $1/3$ provides the best-known guarantee for knapsack CRS even in the offline setting.
Finally, we provide an upper bound of $1/(2+e^{-1})\approx 0.422$ for two-order knapsack CRS, strictly smaller than the upper bound of $(1-e^{-2})/2\approx0.432$ for random-order knapsack CRS.
