	abstract = {In this paper, we identify determinants of pandemic spread in urban populations. Specifically, we develop a multi-agent simulation framework to model virus spread in complex networks.
	Our agents periodically commute between home and work via a combination of walking routes
	and public transit, and make decisions intelligently based upon their location, available routes,
	and expectations of public transport arrival times. Our infection scheme allows for different
	contagiousness levels, as a function of the virus’s strain and where the agents interact (i.e.,
	inside or outside). Our results show that the pandemic’s scale is heavily impacted by the network’s structure, and the decision making of the agents. In particular, the progression of the
	pandemic greatly differs when agents primarily infect each other in a crowded urban transportation system, opposed to while walking. Additionally, the results show that local subgraph
	characteristics, including topology, structure, and statistics such as its degree distribution and
	density, affect the viruses’ transmission rates. We also assess the effect of modifying the public
	transport’s running frequency on the spread of two different virus strains (with different levels
	of contagiousness). In particular, lowering the running frequency can discourage agents from
	taking public transportation too often, especially for shorter distances. On the other hand, the
	low frequency contributes to more crowded streetcars or subway cars if the policy is not designed
	correctly, which is why such an analysis may prove valuable for finding “sweet spots” that optimize the system. The proposed approach has been validated on real world data, and a model
	of the transportation network of downtown Toronto. The framework used is flexible and can
	be easily adjusted to model other urban environments, and additional forms of transportation
	(such as carpooling, ride-share and more).},

  abstract ={Suppose that $K_n$ is the complete graph on vertex set $[n]$, and $\mathcal{D}$ is a distribution on subsets of its edges. The $\mathcal{D}$-adaptive random graph process (or $\mathcal{D}$-process) is a single player game in which the player is initially presented the empty graph on $[n]$. In each step, a subset of edges of $K_n$, say $X$, is independently sampled from $\mathcal{D}$
and presented to the player. The player then adaptively selects precisely one edge $e$ from $X$, and adds $e$ to its current graph. For a fixed (edge) monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy the property in as few steps as possible. 
Through appropriate choices of $\mathcal{D}$, the $\mathcal{D}$-process generalizes well-studied adaptive processes, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process.
		
We prove a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a sharp threshold for the property $\mathcal{P}$ in the $\mathcal{D}$-process. We apply our theorem to the semi-random graph process and prove the existence of a sharp threshold when $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to containing a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random graph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when $\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to containing a \textit{sparse} spanning graph. Using a separate analytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form $C_{\mathcal{P}}n$  for some fixed constant $C_{\mathcal{P}}>0$. This answers two of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al. (SODA 2020) in the affirmative. Unlike similar results which establish sharp thresholds for certain distributions and properties, we establish the existence of sharp thresholds without explicitly identifying asymptotically optimal strategies.},
