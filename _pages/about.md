I'm a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Columbia Business School where I'm advised by Will Ma. 
Previously, I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto under the supervision
of Allan Borodin. I'm fortunate to be supported by an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship (PDF).

I'm interested in optimization under uncertainty, particularly in the presence of randomness. 
This includes problems such as prophet inequalities, assortment optimization, and stochastic matching. A focus
of my work is designing algorithms for these problems via randomized rounding tools.
