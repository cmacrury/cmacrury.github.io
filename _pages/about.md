I'm a fourth year PhD student in the theory group at the University of Toronto, where I'm fortunate to be supervised by Dr. Allan Borodin.
Previously, I obtained a master's degree in mathematics from McGill University under the supervision of Dr. Dmitry Jakobson, and before that, I completed my
undergraduate studies at Dalhousie University. 



I'm broadly interested in topics which intersect between probabilistic combinatorics
and algorithm design. More specifically, I work on combinatorics problems which involve
randomness in the underlying discrete structure, typically in the context of random graphs
and processes. Lately, I've been researching the fast construction of sparse subgraphs in the semi-random graph process. I'm also interested in random hypergraphs and matrices, 
and have researched both in the context of discrepancy theory. My work in combinatorial optimization is in online algorithms,
and more generally, decision making under uncertainty. I'm especially interested in stochastic matching problems.



You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
