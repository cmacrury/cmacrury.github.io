I'm a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School where I'm advised by Will Ma.
Previously, I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto under the supervision
of Allan Borodin, and before that, I obtained a master's degree in mathematics from McGill University under the supervision of Dr. Dmitry Jakobson.
